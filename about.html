          <h2>Brazilian, born Italy. 1914–1992</h2>
          <p>
            Lina Bo Bardi was more than just an architect—she was a creative force who blended art, architecture, and culture into everything she touched. Born in Italy and later becoming one of Brazil’s most influential architects, her work went beyond designing buildings; it shaped how people live, interact, and think about space.

One of her most iconic creations is the Glass House (Casa de Vidro), which she designed as her own home in São Paulo. Suspended on slender stilts, it became a symbol of modern Brazilian architecture—light, open, and deeply connected to nature. She also designed the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP), famous for its bold red concrete beams that leave the museum floating above the ground, making space for the public underneath. It was her way of saying that art should be accessible to everyone.

Lina’s work at SESC Pompéia, a former factory turned vibrant cultural center, is another powerful example of her belief in reusing old spaces and putting community first. Inside, you’ll find galleries, theaters, pools, and even cozy corners to just hang out—because for Lina, architecture was always about people, not just concrete and steel.

Whether she was designing furniture, curating exhibitions, or sketching out entire city blocks, Lina Bo Bardi brought a human touch to everything she did. Her legacy still inspires artists, architects, and dreamers around the world to think differently about the spaces we live in.
